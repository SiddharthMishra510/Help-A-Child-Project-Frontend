Iteration 0

- create a search bar
- assume search is by name
- filter children 'by-name' based on the search query
- When search is cleared through clearing of the search bar manually, refresh the page (to default)
- filter out the carousel to only list the children fitting the search

Iteration 1

- send a backend query assuming it is for 'by-name' for all children for that name
- When search is cleared through a button, refresh the page (to default)
- Only execute the search for when 'Enter' is pressed when search bar is focused
- If there are no results, then show "no results" in UI

Iteration 2

- DON'T assume search is by name, instead
- Manually enlist all fields on the backend database (that can be searched upon) on the frontend dropdown
- add this dropdown next to the search bar and let user select a search parameter (default to name)

Iteration 3

- DON'T manually enlist all fields on the backend database (that can be searched upon) on the frontend dropdown, instead
- Fetch to enlist all fields on the backend database (that can be searched upon) on the frontend dropdown

Iteration 4

- Don't search based on search parameters, instead just do global search on all fields of the children database

Iteration 5

- Use concepts like levenshtein distance to allow for typos in search

I am making something really basic. A website where you can track support for underpriviledged children and see what they aspire to do, what their interests are, etc and donate if you feel like.
So essentially it'd have a list of children on the server with info and then you can donate for them.# Task-Management-project

I want to learn TS/node. I want to create a backend project (and will later create a minimal frontend). 
Preferably using a non-relational database. Hence, I am creating this project.

ðŸ“Œ Features of the Task Management API
âœ… User authentication (register, login, JWT-based auth)
âœ… Create, update, delete tasks
âœ… Assign tasks to users
âœ… Task status updates (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
âœ… Retrieve tasks (by user, by status, etc.)

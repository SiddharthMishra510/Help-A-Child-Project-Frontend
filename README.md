# Task-Management-project

I want to learn TS/node. I want to create a backend project (and will later create a minimal frontend). 
Preferably using a non-relational database. Hence, I am creating this project.

ðŸ“Œ Features of the Task Management API
âœ… User authentication (register, login, JWT-based auth)
âœ… Create, update, delete tasks
âœ… Assign tasks to users
âœ… Task status updates (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
âœ… Retrieve tasks (by user, by status, etc.)
